# Hyprdvd

Bounce that terminal like a DVD screen.

# Why?

Good question, I got the idea, made a simple script to test it out and then it got out of hands.

## Installation and use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nevimmu/hyprdvd
cd hyprdvd
pipx install .

hyprdvd # To run the script
```

To create a DVD term it needs to have the title DVD, for example: `kitty --title DVD`
